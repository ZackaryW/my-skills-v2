# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This goal-driven skills repository provides a test-driven, structured approach inspired by Jira user stories. It addresses common limitations of traditional skill repositories that lack validation and quality assurance.

## Problems It Solves
- **Common Issue**: Skills often lack clear acceptance criteria
- **Common Issue**: No structured testing approach for skills
- **Common Issue**: Difficult to validate if a skill truly works as intended
- **Common Issue**: Rigid structures with disconnected conditions, conventions, and scripts
- **Need**: Better alignment with agile/iterative development
- **Need**: Clear feedback loops for skill improvement
- **Need**: Unified structure where everything is a skill with optional/required features

## How It Should Work

### Skill Definition Pattern
```
Skill: {skill-name}
├── Goal: What the skill aims to achieve
├── Acceptance Criteria: When is the skill considered successful?
├── Features:
│   ├── Feature 1
│   │   ├── Test Scenarios
│   │   └── Expected Results
│   ├── Feature 2
│   │   ├── Test Scenarios
│   │   └── Expected Results
└── Implementation (follows AI conventions)
```

### Workflow
1. **Define Goal**: Clear objective for the skill
2. **Set Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable success conditions
3. **Break into Features**: Logical components of the skill
4. **Create Test Scenarios**: How to validate each feature
5. **Define Expected Results**: What success looks like
6. **Implement**: Follow conventional AI skill standards
7. **Validate**: Run test scenarios against expected results
8. **Iterate**: Refine based on feedback

## User Experience Goals
- Skills feel more reliable and trustworthy
- Easy to validate if a skill works correctly
- Clear understanding of what each skill accomplishes
- Better debugging when skills fail
- Smooth integration with AI assistants

## AI Integration
Skills are designed to:
- Work seamlessly with AI assistant invocation patterns
- Follow established AI standards
- Be easily discoverable and usable
- Maintain compatibility across different AI tools
