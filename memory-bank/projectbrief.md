# Project Brief: Goal-Driven Skills Repository

## Overview
A goal-driven skills repository following Jira user story methodology, focusing on test-driven development with acceptance criteria, features, and test scenarios.

## Core Requirements
- Structure skills around goals and acceptance criteria (Jira user story pattern)
- Define features with clear test scenarios and expected results
- Maintain compatibility with AI standards for skill invocation
- Support test-driven development approach for skills
- Provide clear feedback loops for skill validation

## Goals
1. Create skills with clear, testable acceptance criteria
2. Improve skill quality through scenario-based testing
3. Enable better skill validation and debugging
4. Maintain compatibility with AI standards for skill invocation

## Key Architectural Principles
- Goal-oriented with acceptance criteria
- Feature-driven with test scenarios
- Test scenario → Expected results pattern
- Feedback loop for continuous validation
- Everything is a skill (no separate conditions/, conventions/, scripts/ directories)
- Optional vs required features replace separate condition/convention files

## Scope
- Skills with testable outcomes
- Automated workflows with clear success criteria
- Reusable patterns following AI conventions

## Success Criteria
- Each skill has defined goals and acceptance criteria
- Features are validated through test scenarios
- Skills integrate seamlessly with AI assistants
- Clear feedback mechanisms for skill improvement
